AI-SecurityCam is a real-time surveillance system designed to enhance safety and security using state-of-the-art object detection technologies. Leveraging deep learning models such as YOLOv8, MobileNetV2, and EfficientDet-Lite4, this project identifies and tracks objects like people or potential threats (e.g., weapons, animals) through a connected camera feed. It captures frames upon detecting specified objects, with additional features like email notifications for real-time alerts.

Key Features:

Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 and MobileNetV2.
Save detected frames for review and analysis.
Optional email alerts for detected objects, using Mailtrap.
Flexible implementation through OpenCV for image capture and display.
Support for Docker deployment for easy setup and scaling.
This project is ideal for use in home security systems, business surveillance, and monitoring public spaces, providing a cost-effective and adaptable AI-powered solution for real-time threat detection and alerting.
